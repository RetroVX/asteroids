### About
I wanted to make a small game and learn about using Vue with phaser(3),
so i decided to create asteroids with a small twist. This project was made in two days so it is still incomplete.
Vue is used to update the score, multiplier and ship lives on the DOM,
it is also used with localStorage to save/load the top 5 high scores.

### Todo
* custom controls
* add sfx/music
